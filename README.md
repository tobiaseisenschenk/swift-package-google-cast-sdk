# GoogleCast Sender SDK - Swift Package

## Why

As described on [Google's developer docs](https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/ios_sender#manual_setup) and tracked in [this issue](https://issuetracker.google.com/u/0/issues/190966385?pli=1) there is no Swift Package support for the Google Cast Sender SDK for iOS.
This is a small wrapper referencing the library provided by Google in a SPM friendly format.
